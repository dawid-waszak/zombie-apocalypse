<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About the project

![Game Screen Shot][game-screenshot-2]

I have created this game when I was younger. At the beggining I wanted to participate in some Game Jam, to finally create fully playable game. All in all this game did not take part in the event, but finished my project in few days.

Every model was created by me in Blender. <br/><br/>

There are 4 types of enemies: 
 * normal
 * fast,
 * big,
 * and fat zombie

And 8 types of weapons:
 * default,
 * revolver,
 * shotgun normal,
 * powerful shotgun,
 * uzi,
 * rifle,
 * sniper,
 * and grenade launcher

In game are available also special buffs that drops from enemies some times:
 * health buff - regenarate healthbar,
 * speed buff - for 30s you did not lose stamina.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Controls

 * WASD - moving,
 * Mouse - rotation and shooting,
 * 1 i 2 - weapon slots,
